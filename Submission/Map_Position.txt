This area consists of the cities of Kitchener, Waterloo, and Cambridge which are locally referred to as the 'Tri-Cities'.
This area is where I went to university, and now live and work. It is the home of RIM/Blackberry, and countless other tech start-ups.

I chose this area because I live here and am familiar with it. I enjoyed pulling out some stats for the area, but could easily see the incompleteness
in many things.
